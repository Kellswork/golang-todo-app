## TypeScript Configuration and Setup

This branch is for the code used in the article "Golang Todo App: HTML Templates and Static Assets" and explains how to set up TypeScript to replace vanilla JavaScript when building the front end of the todo app. 

This branch is a follow-up to the ["SETUP HTML TEMPLATES AND ASSETS FIle"](https://github.com/Kellswork/golang-todo-app/tree/feat/setup-html-template-and-asset-files) and handles the TypeScript configuration and setup. The article provides a step-by-step guide to help you set up TypeScript for the todo app.

# Golang Todo App
