## Frontend Todo App: Built with TypeScript and Fetch API

This branch is the tutorial 'Build a CRUD Todo App with TypeScript and Fetch API'.


Previously, we built the [ Golang Todo App Backend](https://www.agirlcodes.dev/build-todo-app-backend-golang-tutorial) and [connected the frontend to the backend](https://www.agirlcodes.dev/golang-setup-html-templates-and-static-assets). We want to develop the frontend part of the todo app and consume the backend API endpoints.

The tutorial covers these features;

- creating a Todo,
- reading a list of Todo items,
- editing a Todo item from the list of displayed items,
- deleting an item from the list,
- and marking a Todo item as completed or not.


Technology used
- TypeScript
- Fetch-API
- Golang sever

## Getting Started
You can copy the HTML, CSS and JavaScript content and host the files as you please. It will work on the browser.

I used a Golang server to host the front end. You can find the article for building the Github Repo [here](https://github.com/Kellswork/golang-todo-app) and hosting the frontend assets on the backend server with typescript config [here](https://github.com/Kellswork/golang-todo-app/tree/feat/add-typescript-configuration).

or
 - You can clone this branch.
 - start the go server with `go run main.go`. 
 - navigate to `localhost:9000`.
