## Golang Todo App: HTML Templates and Static Assets

This branch is for the code in the article "Golang Todo App: HTML Templates and Static Assets" and explains how to generate and render HTML templates and serve static CSS and JavaScript files using Golang.

Additionally, there is a separate branch dedicated to handling the [TypeScript configuration and setup](https://github.com/Kellswork/golang-todo-app/tree/feat/add-typescript-configuration) aspect of the article.
The article serves as a guide on how to render HTML templates and serve static files.

Previously, we built the [ Golang Todo App Backend](https://www.agirlcodes.dev/build-todo-app-backend-golang-tutorial) and now we want to connect the frontend and backend to have a full-stack web application.
golang todo backend is currently on the `main branch`.

# Golang Todo App

Golang Todo App is a simple todo app backend created to teach how to create CRUD REST APis with Golang and Mongo DB for database. I wrote about how to build a simple golang todo app and this is the github repository for the todo project built in the article.

If you are new to programming or a Dev who desires to learn Golang, this is a way you can slowly introduce yourself to the language and understand the basics and how building APIs work in Go.
